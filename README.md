# Multi Persistence Backend

This project was developed as part of a Bachelor's thesis in Computer Engineering.

The goal is to compare **relational (SQL)** and **NoSQL** database paradigms by implementing the same backend application using:

- PostgreSQL (relational model via JPA/Hibernate)
- MongoDB (document model via Spring Data MongoDB)

The application is designed to **dynamically switch between the two databases** using a configuration property, enabling a direct comparison of:

- data modeling approaches
- query strategies
- performance characteristics
- consistency and constraint handling

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Provide a unified API layer independent from the underlying database
- Compare relational and document-based data modeling
- Analyze trade-offs between SQL and NoSQL
- Demonstrate real-world backend patterns using both approaches

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- Dual database support (PostgreSQL / MongoDB)
- Runtime switch via configuration property (`app.datasource`)
- Shared business logic across implementations
- REST API generated from OpenAPI specification
- Swagger UI for API exploration
- Validation with Jakarta Bean Validation
- Caching with Caffeine
- Health checks and metrics via Spring Actuator
- Containerized environment (Docker & Docker Compose)
- Integration testing with Testcontainers
- Code formatting with Spotless
- Code coverage with JaCoCo
- Cross-cutting logging and HTTP tracing via Spring AOP aspects

---
